          <h1>How you can improve mental health in the time of pandemic?</h1>
          <h2></h2>
          <p>
            Mental health is an amalgamation of emotional, psychological, and
            social well-being. It affects how we think, feel, and act as we cope
            with life. It also helps determine how we handle stress, relate to
            others, and make choices. Mental health is important at every stage
            of life, from childhood and adolescence through adulthood and aging.
          </p>
          <h3></h3>
          <ul>
            <p>
              There are many different things you can do to improve your mental
              health, including
            </p>
            <li>
              <b>Staying positive</b> It’s important to try to have a positive
              outlook; some ways to do that include finding a balance between
              positive and negative emotions. Staying positive doesn't mean that
              you never feel negative emotions, such as sadness or anger. You
              need to feel them so that you can move through difficult
              situations. They can help you to respond to a problem. But you
              don't want those emotions to take over. For example, it's not
              helpful to keep thinking about bad things that happened in the
              past or worry too much about the future.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Connecting with others</b> Humans are social creatures, and
              it's important to have strong, healthy relationships with others.
              Having good social support may help protect you against the harms
              of stress. It is also good to have different types of connections.
              Besides connecting with family and friends, you could find ways to
              get involved with your community or neighborhood. For example, you
              could volunteer for a local organization or join a group that is
              focused on a hobby you enjoy.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Developing coping skills</b> which are methods you use to deal
              with stressful situations. They may help you face a problem, take
              action, be flexible, and not easily give up in solving it.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Developing a sense of meaning and purpose in life. </b> This
              could be through your job, volunteering, learning new skills, or
              exploring your spirituality.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Taking care of your physical health </b> since your physical
              and mental health are connected. Some ways to take care of your
              physical health include <br />Being physically active. Exercise
              can reduce feelings of stress and depression and improve your
              mood.<br />
              Getting enough sleep. Sleep affects your mood. If you don't get a
              good sleep, you may become more easily annoyed and angry. Over the
              long term, a lack of quality sleep can make you more likely to
              become depressed. So it's important to make sure that you have a
              regular sleep schedule and get enough quality sleep every night.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Meditation</b> Meditation is a mind and body practice where you
              learn to focus your attention and awareness. There are many types,
              including mindfulness meditation and transcendental meditation.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Track gratitude and achievement with a journal</b>
              Include 3 things you were grateful for and 3 things you were able
              to accomplish each day.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>sleeping well</b>
              Keep it cool for a good night's sleep. The optimal temperature for
              sleep is between 60 and 67 degrees Fahrenheit.
            </li>
          </ul>
